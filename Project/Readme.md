#OS Mini Project : Banking Management System 

##Overview
This mini project aims to model a banking system which supports three types of users - normal, joint and admin. Users can use basic functionalities of the banking system, which include authentication, depost and withdrawal. A concurrent server is used to facilitate multiple clients at once. In order to demonstrate file locking, we show that multiple users holding a joint account can query the server simultaneously.
